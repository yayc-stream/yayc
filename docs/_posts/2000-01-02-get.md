Latest binary releases: [Windows](https://github.com/yayc-stream/yayc/releases/download/yayc-v1.3.0/yayc-v1.3.0-win-x64-portable.zip) (you might need [Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable package](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-IT/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022) if you get an error about missing VCRUNTIME140_1.dll)

### Build from sources
Alternately, it is possible to build YAYC from [sources](https://github.com/yayc-stream/yayc).
To do so, a [Qt 5.15](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) installation is necessary, together with a C++ toolchain
(gcc on Linux, msvc on Windows).
Please note that OpenSSL needs to be enable and working within the Qt 5.15 installation.
More details on how to proceed setting up the build environment can be found on the [project page](https://github.com/yayc-stream/yayc)
